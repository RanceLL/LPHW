#About If-Statements
1. Every if-statement must have an else.
2. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
3. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if, elif, else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
4. Boolean tests should be simple.
##About Loops
5. Use a for-loop for all kinds of looping instead of using a while-loop.
##About Debugging
6. Do not use any debuggers.
7. Best way to debug: use PRINT to print out the values of variables at points in the program to see what's wrong.
8. Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Code a little, run a little, fix a little.
##General
0. start doing it, do a small version, make it bigger, keep a list of things to do, and do them.
